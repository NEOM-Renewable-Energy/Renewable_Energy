#  Predictive System For Renewable Energy Management 
This Capstone Project is a part of the [Saudi Digital Academy](https://sda.edu.sa/ar) Data Science & AI bootcamp with [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/).

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Overview
This project supports NEOM's sustainable energy management system by developing machine learning models to forecast energy consumption and solar energy production. Accurate predictions allow NEOM to balance energy supply and demand, ensuring efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness in line with Vision 2030's renewable energy goals.

### Project Motivation
In alignment with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, NEOM aims to be a global leader in sustainable energy. This project addresses the challenges in managing energy consumption, predicting solar energy output, and planning for cost-effective scaling of renewable resources. Key challenges and solutions include:
* Accurate Forecasting: Enable efficient planning to avoid energy shortages or waste
* Balanced Supply and Demand: Maintain equilibrium between energy generation and consumption
* Overcoming Data Scarcity: Develop models that can generalize from limited data
* Cost-Effective Solar Expansion: Estimate costs for expanding solar production effectively


### Dataset
[Consumption dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/electric-power-consumption)

[Production dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pythonafroz/solar-power/data)

## Methodology
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Forecasting Models 
  * Consumption Model: Predicts NEOM's energy demand 
  * Solar Production Model: Forecasts solar electricity output to balance supply with consumption
* Model Evaluation: Evaluates prediction accuracy to ensure reliable energy forecasting


## Results

* Improved Consumption Forecasting: The consumption model identifies energy demand patterns, enabling NEOM to optimize distribution
* Optimized Solar Energy Use: Forecasts help make the most of sunny days and plan for cloudy periods
* Energy Efficiency: Combining both models enables NEOM to efficiently balance energy supply and demand, reduce costs, and minimize waste
* Cost-Efficient Planning: the models helps NEOM plan scalable solar infrastructure growth to meet energy needs
